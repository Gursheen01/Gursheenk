  <h2>What is SEM?</h2>
  <p>Search engine marketing (SEM) is a digital marketing strategy used to increase the visibility of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs).

While the industry term once referred to both organic search activities such as search engine optimization (SEO) and paid, it now refers almost exclusively to paid search advertising.

Search engine marketing is also alternately referred to as paid search or pay per click (PPC)</p>
 </section>
<section>
<h2>Why is SEM important?</h2>
<p>With an increasing number of consumers researching and shopping for products online, search engine marketing has become a crucial online marketing strategy for increasing a company’s reach.

In fact, the majority of new visitors to a website find it by performing a query on a search engine.

In search engine marketing, advertisers only pay for impressions that result in visitors, making it an efficient way for a company to spend its marketing dollars. As an added bonus, each visitor incrementally improves the website’s rankings in organic search results.</p>
<p><strong>7 Step of making SEM strategy:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keyword research</strong> Start by conducting basic keyword research to discover relevant keywords using tools like Google’s Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs</li>
    <li><strong>Setting up PPC campaigns</strong> PPC campaigns are generally structured around central themes or topics that are tied to specific business outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Create ad copy</strong> Once you’ve created your campaigns and your ad groups, it’s time to create ad copy that speaks directly to potential customers</li>
<li><strong>Optimize landing pages</strong>Ensure your landing pages are relevant to the ad copy that got your users there in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Manage your bid strategy</strong> Before getting into budget allocation, you’ll need to start running ads in order to ascertain which bidding strategy yields the best results for you</li>
<li><strong>Allocate budget</strong> Focus your budget on the highest performing ads and target them to your most relevant segments</li>
<li><strong>Refine and optimize</strong> There are many ways to improve the overall performance of your ads once you have your campaigns running.

    1.Improve quality score to lower the total cost of ads showing up.

    2.Add extensions like sitelinks to highlight specific web pages, callouts to    	highlight specific features, call extensions for phone numbers, or even 	customized URLs to improve click-through rates (CTR).

   3.Implement remarketing to reinforce brand awareness and ensure your ads are 	staying top of mind as they continue browsing onto other apps or pages.
</li>

<h2>How SEM works?</h2><p>While SEO strategy relies heavily on content marketing to drive organic traffic, SEM strategy relies heavily on targeted ads to drive paid traffic.

Search engines use complicated algorithms to ensure the most relevant results are returned for each search, including location and other available information.

In paid search advertising, sponsored ads appear at the top of and on the side of search engine results pages to gain more visibility and prominence than the organic results.

Let’s say that you are a customer looking for a product or service online. You go to a search engine and type in your search terms (also known as keywords).

In your search results page, you will come across various company ads whose keywords match the keywords in your search.

These ads appear in prominent locations on the page – along with the other search listings that match your keywords. The paid listings are highly relevant to your specific search, making it likely that you will click on them.

Now let’s take a look at how SEM campaigns work from the marketer’s perspective.

SEM networks are self-serve operations. Once a marketer selects a network, they can get a campaign up within a short period of time.</p>
 
</section>
<section>
<h2>Examples of search ad networks</h2>
<p>
The two primary search networks that SEM professionals target are Google Ads (formerly Google Adwords) and the Bing Ads.

Google AdWords is actually two networks: Google Search Network and Google Display Network. The first network consists exclusively of search-related websites owned by Google, while the second includes properties such as YouTube, Blogger and Gmail. The Bing Ads allows customers to buy ads on both Yahoo’s network of websites and Bing’s network.

While Google Ads is a much larger network (around 2x the size), the pricing is often lower on Bing Ads. Marketers may be able to get a better rank for a competitive keyword phrase for less than they get on Google. And some report that the clickthrough rates are higher as well.
